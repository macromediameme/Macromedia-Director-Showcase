      <P>I think the term for what I am trying to do is called a countdown bar 
      or an energy bar. It will be a graphic which will go down in size as time 
      elapses. Can you help? 
      <P>Mike Oscar <MIKE.OSCAR@JKD.CO.UK>
      <P>Dear Mike, 
      <P>What you're describing sounds like a progress bar -- similar to what 
      you see when you're downloading a file or installing a program. The 
      difference is that you want the progress tied to time (rather than bytes 
      downloaded) and you want the bar to shrink over time, rather than grow. 
      You don't mention whether the bar will be horizontal or vertical, so I'll 
      just create something that works either way. 
      <P>Let's think about what we want the author (you) to be able to specify 
      when you drop it on a sprite. Obviously, you'll want to enter the number 
      of seconds. You want to say whether the bar is oriented horizontally or 
      vertically. And, although in this instance you want it to shrink, let's 
      add an option so that the bar can either increase or decrease in size. 
      Here's what it should look like. 
      <P><IMG alt="" border=0 height=130 src="handy98_files/handy98.gif" 
      width=374> 
      <P>And here's what the final result could look like. 
      <P>

      format 
      <P>So how do we make it work? Everything you're seeing in the demo above 
      is handled by one behavior, which I'm calling the "progressBar timer". 
      Here's the concept in a nutshell: as soon as the sprite comes into 
      existence, it starts a timer. It also checks its own width (or height, if 
      the bar is vertical). Then, at each frame after that (until the specified 
      amount of time as elapsed) it calculates how much time has passed as a 
      percentage of the total time specified. This percentage is then applied to 
      the original width of the sprite to yeild a graphic representation of the 
      time. 
      <P>In our beginSprite handler, we'll need to initialize values for several 
      properties of the sprite: width, height, and sprite number. We'll also 
      convert the seconds to ticks (60ths of a second) so that our calculations 
      will be more precise. We'll then record the starting time (in ticks). 
      Finally, we need to add this behavior instance to the actorList. What the 
      heck does that mean? 
      <P>The actorList is a feature used mostly by people who are doing higher 
      level object oriented programming. But it's very easy to use, once you 
      grasp the concept. Here's how it works and why you'd want to use it. 
      <P>In our example, we want the behavior to update its size every frame. So 
      we could just use an enterFrame, exitFrame or prepareFrame handler for 
      that. Right? Well... almost. In actuality, we want the behavior to update 
      its size every frame... <B>until the full time has elapsed.</B> After the 
      time has elapsed, there's no need to waste the processor's time by going 
      through that handler anymore. Alot of times, I use a "flag" property to 
      act as a switch, but that's a little inefficient because the behavior 
      still has to check the status of the flag every frame -- even if it is 
      "off". 
      <P>Instead, we can use "the actorList". Any object which is contained in 
      the actorList automatically gets a prompt from Director every frame. The 
      prompt is called "stepFrame". It's as if on every frame, Director looks in 
      the actorList. If it sees "Bob" in the actorlist, it says "Hey Bob, 
      execute that stepFrame handler!". 
      <P>So, what we'll do is add this behavior to the list in the beginSprite 
      handler. Then, after the time has elapsed, the behavior will delete itself 
      from the actorList and it won't get the prompt to stepFrame anymore. The 
      main guts of our behavior will be executed in the stepFrame handler. <PRE><FONT color=#cc0000>property pSecs, pTotalTicks, pWidth, pHeight, pSprite

      <P>The stepFrame handler isn't very complicated. It looks about twice as 
      long as necessary because I've included the option for the bar to be 
      oriented vertically. So, for every command to change the size of the bar, 
      there's an if statement that checks the pOrientation property and then 
      issues the appropriate command to adjust either the width or height. 
      <P>The first thing the stepFrame handler does is check to see if the full 
      time has elapsed. If so, it checks to see if the bar was counting up or 
      down and then sets the sprite to its full width/height, or to 0. And then 
      it does something very important: it removes itself from the actorList. 
      After that, you can insert whatever else you want to happen when time has 
      elapsed. I've included a "beep" just to show you where to insert your 
      additional instructions. 
      <P>If the time has not fully elapsed, then it does the percentage 
      calculation, comparing ticks elapsed to total ticks specified. This 
      percentage is then applied to the width/height -- either positively or 
      negatively (depending on whether it's counting up or down.) 
      <P>Here's an interesting thing about the actorList. Once you add the 
      behavior to the actorList, it will remain in existence even if the sprite 
      goes away. So, if you start this behavior and it gets added to the 
      actorList, it will persist even if you move to another place in the score 
      -- or ever to another movie. That could screw you up if you didn't realize 
      what was happening. Therefore, I've included the endSprite handler that 
      deletes it from the actorList. 
      <P>One final thing to note is the getPropertyDescriptionList handler. For 
      pOrientation and pDirection, I wanted to have 2 specific choices. For 
      example, the orientation can only be either horizontal or vertical, and 
      it's great to have these choices on a pulldown menu. To do that, specify a 
      #range as a list [#horizontal, #vertical]. I went one step further. I 
      wanted the behavior to be smart enough to guess whether the orientation 
      should be vertical or horizontal. So, instead of specifying one or the 
      other as the default, I used a variable called defOrientation. 
      <P>The first few lines of the gpdl handler compare the width and height of 
      the member in the current sprite. If height is more than width, then it 
      guesses that the defOrientation should be #vertical. Otherwise, it's 
      #horizontal. Try this feature for yourself by dropping the behavior first 
      onto a wide sprite, then onto a tall one. The default in the dialog box 
      will know which way to go -- though you can override it, of course. 
      <P>One last note. In my demo, the horizontal bars are "anchored" to the 
      left side, and the vertical bars are locked to the bottom of the range. 
      You can change this by resetting the regPoint of the cast member. In the 
      demo above, the horizontal cast member has a regPoint of point(0,0) -- top 
      left. The vertical members have a regPoint set to the bottom left corner. 
      Play with the regPoint to come up with variations which meet your needs. 
      <P>Good luck with your project.

MOA allows Xtrasfor all applications to conform to a single set of programmingconstructs and conventions. <P>The MOA object model is derived from the Microsoft Component ObjectModel (COM), used to implement OLE (Object Linking and Embedding).However, while COM is designed as a universal, system-level objectmodel, MOA is intended to be more task-specific. The scope ofMOA is those areas within Macromedia applications that can benefitfrom runtime extensions. The purpose of MOA is to provide a consistent,modular way to define and implement those extensions. This restrictionbenefits MOA programmers by allowing them to focus on specificfeatures rather than learning a large, general purpose system.<P>MOA is in one sense a subset of COM, and MOA objects are binarycompatible with COM. However, no effort has been made to implementall features of COM, such as certain interfaces required by OLEobjects. If you're familiar with COM, you should find many similaritiesin this discussion. If you're not familiar with COM, this discussionprovides all the background you need to understand MOA. <BR><BR></DL><h4><font face=arial,helvetica,sans-serif><A NAME="RTFToC2">MOA and XDKs</A> </font></h4><DL><DT><DD>While MOA provides the general mechanism and some standardAPI for implementing Xtras, specific Xtra functionality is implementedthrough task-specific API. This API is developed in conjunctionwith specific Macromedia applications, and is made available throughXtra Development Kits (XDKs) as the applications supporting theseXtras become available. <BR></DL><h3><font face=arial,helvetica,sans-serif><A NAME="RTFToC3">About this document</A> </font></h3><DL><DT><DD><DT><DD>This document provides a general introduction to MOA.

The documentation for the additions and changes made   to the Director 8 XDK are in the <a href="d8xdk_addendum.html">xdk8_addendum.html   file</a> in the Docs folder.</P><FONT FACE="Arial,helvetica"><H4><A NAME="RTFToC2">What's an Xtra?</A> </H4></FONT><P>Xtras are code extensions to Macromedia applications such as Director and Authorware. For the user, Xtras add custom features to tools they already know how to use. For the developer, Xtras are C-code object modules that use the Xtra Application Programming Interface (API) to extend the functionality of Macromedia applications. All Xtra API is implemented using the Macromedia Open Architecture (MOA). MOA defines an object model that provides standard ways for applications and extensions to interact. </P><p>An Xtra Development Kit (XDK) provides the resources you need to implement   Xtras for Macromedia products. In addition to documentation, this XDK provides   header files for the API supported by Director, and examples of how to implement   several kinds of Director Xtra. </p><p>The resources provided by the Director XDK are organized in the following directories:</p><table BORDER cellspacing=1 width=504>  <tr>    <td width="16%" valign="MIDDLE">       <p><tbody><b>Directory</b>    </td>    <td width="84%" valign="MIDDLE">       <p><b>Contents</b>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td width="16%" valign="MIDDLE">       <p>Docs     </td>    <td width="84%" valign="MIDDLE">       <p>Director XDK and MOA documentation in html format     </td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td width="16%" valign="MIDDLE">       <p>Examples     </td>    <td width="84%" valign="MIDDLE">       <p>Project files for Director Xtra examples     </td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td width="16%" valign="MIDDLE">       <p>Includes     </td>    <td width="84%" valign="MIDDLE">       <p>Header files for Xtra development     </td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td width="16%" valign="MIDDLE">       <p>Utility     </td>    <td width="84%" valign="MIDDLE">       <p>Utility programs for use in developing Xtras     </td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td width="16%" valign="MIDDLE">       <p>Xtras     </td>    <td width="84%" valign="MIDDLE">       <p>Compiled versions of the example Xtras     </td>  </tr></table><p>The Xtras folder should be moved to the folder where the Director application   resides.

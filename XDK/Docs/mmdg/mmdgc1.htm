Transitions can combine visual changeelements with sounds and other media. <A HREF="mmdgc2.htm">&quot;Asset Xtras&quot;</A>describes the Transition Xtra API. <BR><BR><B>Sprite Xtras</B> are a type of asset that provide customizedinteractive behavior in multimedia presentations. In Director,sprites can represent themselves in both the cast and score ofa movie. Sprite Xtras can display themselves in a multimediapiece, interact with user actions such as mouse clicks and keypresses, and respond to both standard and custom properties andfunctions in the application's native scripting language. <A HREF="mmdgc2.htm">&quot;Asset Xtras&quot;</A>describes the Sprite Xtra API. <BR><BR><B>Scripting Xtras</B> provide ways to extend the capabilitiesof Lingo in Director to include newfunctionality. Scripting Xtras are a cross-product extension ofthe Lingo Xtras supported in Director 5.0. Using the Directorservices API, Scripting Xtras can control presentationsand manipulate their content. In Director, Scripting Xtras canbe combined with movies in a window to provide complete custombehavior and user interfaces. <A HREF="mmdgc3.htm">&quot;Scripting Xtras&quot;</A>describes the Scripting Xtra API. <BR><BR><B>Tool Xtras</B> provide a way to display arbitrary windows presentingtools fo manipulating Director features at author time. Like ScriptingXtras, Tools can use the Director API to controlthe features of a presentation. Tool Xtras are displayed in theXtras menu, and are supported in the Director authoringapplications, not in players. <A HREF="mmdgc4.htm">&quot;Tool Xtras&quot;</A>describes the Tool Xtra API. <BR><P><A HREF="mmdgtg.htm" >&quot;Tips, Guidelines, and Gotchas&quot;</A>describes some useful details to be aware of when coding Xtrasfor Director.<HR width=45% align=left><P><A HREF="../copyrite.htm">Copyright &#169; 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999 Macromedia, Inc.</A></BODY></HTML>

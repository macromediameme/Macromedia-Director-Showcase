Note: Early versions of Director 7 have a known bug 
regarding the receipt of the mouseUp message by an 
incorrect cast member.  In the Lessons using the Gallery 
movies you may occasionally experience the program 
branching back to the Menu screen from the Privation 
screen.  This is not a result of your programming, 
but results from the dotbottom sprite incorrectly 
receiving the mouseUp message after the Privation sprite 
is clicked.  This should be fixed in later releases of 
Director 7.  If this problem happens to you, you can try 
a work-around  of moving the sprite in channel 5, 
frame 30 (26:dotbottom) to channel 6.
We apologize for any inconvenience.
